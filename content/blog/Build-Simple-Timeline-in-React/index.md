This is a super awesome blog post! This text is going to show as an excerpt on the /blog page. How cool is that?

Here is a video:

Here is how you can write some code:

```python
# Python program to swap two variables

x = 5
y = 10

# To take inputs from the user
#x = input('Enter value of x: ')
#y = input('Enter value of y: ')

# create a temporary variable and swap the values
temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print('The value of x after swapping: {}'.format(x))
print('The value of y after swapping: {}'.format(y))
```

That was Python and this is JavaScript:

```js
//JavaScript program to swap two variables

//take input from the users
let a = prompt("Enter the first variable: ")
let b = prompt("Enter the second variable: ")

//create a temporary variable
let temp

//swap variables
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

console.log(`The value of a after swapping: ${a}`)
console.log(`The value of b after swapping: ${b}`)
```
