        <h1> - Hi! I'm Aleks! -</h1>
        <p>Thanks for asking! I'm a full stack developer from Belgrade, Serbia. I build web apps and 
        websites, design user interfaces and drink a lot of coffee.</p>

        <p>After office hours I like to write some more code, dabble in game development and create random HTML, CSS and JavaScript stuff.
        My greatest passions are books and video games, so it's no coincidence that I like to read, write and play (a lot).</p>

        <p>These pages are intended as a personal website where I showcase my previous (and occasionally current) work and
        which I will use as a sort of a public reminder on anything and everything.</p>
    </div>
